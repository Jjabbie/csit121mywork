            <h2>Why WebAuthn Matters</h2>
            <p>
                The Web Authentication API addresses one of the most significant vulnerabilities in modern web security: weak or stolen passwords. Traditional password systems are prone to phishing attacks, brute force attempts, and data breaches, putting user accounts and sensitive data at risk. WebAuthn eliminates the need for passwords by introducing strong authentication methods.

            <h2>Enhancing Security with Passwordless Authentication</h2>
            <p>
                Passwordless authentication improves security by requiring physical devices, biometric data, or other secure credentials that cannot be easily stolen or guessed. This reduces dependency on memorized information and creates a more reliable layer of security. It also minimizes the attack surface by ensuring credentials are stored locally on a user's device instead of a centralized server.

            <h2>User Experience Benefits</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond security, WebAuthn significantly enhances the user experience. It allows users to log in quickly using a fingerprint, face scan, or hardware security key, making authentication faster and more intuitive. This creates a seamless experience for end-users while reducing administrative burdens for organizations managing password resets and account recoveries.
