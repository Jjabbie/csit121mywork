      <h2>What This Page is About</h2>
      <p>
        I created this page as part of my CSIT121 Lab 02 assignment. It demonstrates 
        the steps a website publisher needs to follow in order to create and publish 
        a functional webpage online.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Things a Website Publisher Needs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You need a VS Code editor and a GitHub account to host projects</li>
        <li>You need to know how HTML basics works using semantic elements and web standards, and an internet browser to test and validate the page</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps to Publish a Web Page</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a project folder (for example, <strong>lab02</strong>).</li>
        <li>Write your code in <code>index.html</code> using semantic elements.</li>
        <li>Validate the HTML to fix errors and warnings.</li>
        <li>Commit and push the folder to your GitHub repository.</li>
        <li>Publish the link.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Reflection from Lab02</h2>
      <p>
        In this lab it really made me understand how to properly use semantic elements like header, main, article, and footer when creating a web page. 
        I learned the difference between unordered and ordered lists, and why it matters when showing general items versus steps. 
        In the index.html you see that I used the needs of a publisher to represent the unordered list which are the general item and the step when publishing a webpage as ordered list. 
        Now my biggest take was that, for every section of this code you tend to apply something that creates a difference and makes the coding work. 
        For example ul = unordered list, it shows items in bullet points, same applies for the ordered list as ol which show the steps. 
        Also the a href = this create a hyperlink and that was important to support the external links that were added that helped me come to the assignment solution, what a rollercoaster it was. 
        Overall take from this is how important this was to show me how coding and publishing works hand-in-hand. I will definitely utilize these skills in creating something else for myself.

      <h2>Reflection from Lab03</h2>
      <p>
        In Lab03, I learned how to connect an external CSS stylesheet to my webpage and add styling rules 
        to improve its appearance. I practiced using selectors like IDs and classes to target specific 
        elements, and I saw how CSS makes the page more readable and visually appealing. 
        A big lesson for me was understanding how design and content work together to create a 
        professional-looking website.
        Furthermore, I contructed a background color I think it will look more attractive and catches every eye.
        I used a black background color so to make my website more visible with every wording and colors to show explicitly.
        I used a yellow color writings for the body, a purple color for all headings ie h1,h2,and h3. Lastly, a blueviolet for its text declaration
