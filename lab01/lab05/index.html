      <h2>Reflection from Lab 02</h2>
      <p>
        In this lab, it really made me understand how to properly use semantic elements like header, main, article, and footer when creating a web page. 
        I learned the difference between unordered and ordered lists, and why it matters when showing general items versus steps. 
        In the index.html, I used the needs of a publisher to represent the unordered list and the steps when publishing a webpage as an ordered list. 
        My biggest takeaway was realizing how each section of code serves a purpose in making the page functional. 
        Overall, this assignment showed me how coding and publishing work hand-in-hand, and I will definitely use these skills in future projects.

      <h2>Reflection from Lab 03</h2>
      <p>
        In Lab03, I learned how to connect an external CSS stylesheet to my webpage and add styling rules 
        to improve its appearance. I practiced using selectors like IDs and classes to target specific 
        elements, and I saw how CSS makes the page more readable and visually appealing. 
        A big lesson for me was understanding how design and content work together to create a 
        professional-looking website. Furthermore, I constructed a background color I think looks more attractive and eye-catching.
        I used a black background for better visibility, yellow text for contrast, and purple for all headings. Lastly, I used blueviolet for text links to make them stand out.

      <h2>Reflection from Lab 05</h2>
      <p>
        In Lab 05, I found this assignment to be one of the most challenging so far. Creating a responsive design that switches between single-column and multi-column layouts took a lot of trial and error, especially when working with flexbox and media queries. 
        The navigation links gave me the hardest time, I tried multiple times to connect them correctly, but I could not fully figure out why they weren’t working as expected. It was frustrating because I wanted everything to function perfectly, but I couldn’t quite get my hands around the issue before the deadline. 
        Despite the struggles, I learned a lot about layout responsiveness, link anchors, and how small details in CSS and HTML can affect how a page behaves. Even though it was difficult, I’m proud of the effort I put in and glad I managed to complete and submit it on time.
