        Working on this final project helped me understand how to bring together everything I learned this semester. 
        One challenge I faced was creating a clean and consistent style sheet for all pages, so I consulted YouTube to help me over the css
        Testing my site on multiple browsers and my phone taught me how differently layouts behave on different screens. 
        This course helped me build confidence in HTML, CSS, accessibility rules, and responsive design. 
        Overall, I learned how to create a complete website that is structured, functional, and visually appealing.
